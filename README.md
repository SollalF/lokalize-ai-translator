## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Challenges & Current Limitations

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered that impacted the final implementation:

### Lokalise API Integration Complexity

- **Extensive API Surface**: Lokalise provides a vast API with numerous endpoints for projects, keys, translations, comments, screenshots, and file management
- **Authentication & Rate Limits**: Managing API tokens, request limits, and error handling across multiple endpoints
- **Data Model Complexity**: Lokalise's data structures are intricate, requiring comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and careful mapping
- **Endpoint Variations**: Different endpoints have varying parameter requirements and response formats, making standardization challenging

### Time-Constrained Development

- **UI/UX Compromises**: The user interface took a backseat due to time limitations, resulting in functional but not optimally designed components
- **Limited Polish**: Many UI components lack refinement, responsive design considerations, and accessibility features
- **Basic State Management**: Using simple React hooks instead of more robust state management solutions

### Testing Gaps

- **Minimal Test Coverage**: Limited time prevented implementation of comprehensive test suites
- **Manual Testing Only**: Most functionality was verified through manual testing rather than automated tests
- **Integration Testing Missing**: No end-to-end testing of API integrations and user workflows

### Technical Debt

- **Code Organization**: Some components became too large and complex (e.g., `TranslationList.tsx` at 367 lines)
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across components
- **Performance Considerations**: No optimization for large datasets or virtual scrolling implementation

### Backend Integration Issues

- **Glossary Processing**: Backend encountered errors when uploading glossary terms to Lokalise API
- **Metric Calculations**: TER and BLEU score implementations need proper library integration
- **Database Layer Missing**: No persistent storage for LLM evaluations, user preferences, or translation history

### API Design Decisions

- **Frontend-Backend Coupling**: Some API responses are tightly coupled to Lokalise's data format
- **Limited Error Context**: Error messages don't always provide sufficient context for debugging
- **Inconsistent Response Formats**: Some endpoints return different data structures than expected

These challenges highlight the complexity of building production-ready translation management tools and provide a roadmap for future improvements.

## üìà Potential Improvements

### Short-term Enhancements

- **Translation Memory**: Cache and reuse previous translations
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter translations by status, language, date
- **Export Functions**: Download translations in various formats
- **Notification System**: Progress alerts and completion notifications
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Improve productivity with hotkeys

### Infrastructure & Architecture

- **UI Overhaul**: Redesign interface for better scalability and maintainability, right now it is only good for a few translations
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage for LLM comments, translation history, and user analytics
- **Lokalise API Expansion**: Implement comprehensive coverage of remaining API endpoints
- **Multi-container Docker**: Robust orchestrated setup with database, cache, and service containers

- **Code Cleanup**: Refactor legacy code, eliminate duplication, improve maintainability
- **Batch Operations**: More bulk operations (delete, status updates)
- **Translation History**: Track and revert changes with full audit trails
- **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading for large datasets
- **Error Recovery**: Better error handling, retry mechanisms, and user feedback
- **LLM Provider Abstraction**: Use portkey or openrouter to abstract the LLM provider completely
